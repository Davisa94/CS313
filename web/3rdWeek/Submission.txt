These are stretches but two things I would like to do is add a snackbar toast everytime an item is added to the cart, the other is implement an in-stock amount for each item.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
You can dynamically create elements from php using an array

E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

I Put a lot of time and effort into the store and got dynamic totals and sub-totals working. I also made the php redirects more robust using HTTP_REFERER. Furthermore, I added Cohesive style and though I'm not a designer I feel it looks good and a far sight better than it looked before.
